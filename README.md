|-----------------------------------------|

This project implements a couple of blocks to test and understand the Open Synthesis capabilities. 

The first block is a simple educational cpu designed around an 8 bit bus.

The second block is a PWM peripheral for that cpu.

The third is a GPIO block. 

This is all integrated with the Caravel harness such that programming of the cpu may happen.
